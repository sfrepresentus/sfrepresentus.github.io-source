**Why a reboot?**  
The amazing Morgan, who led the group to two ballot wins, has taken a career opportunity on the peninsula and will no longer be able to run the SF chapter. Other key members have also recently moved on to opportunities outside of the city. The chapter was briefly shut down and we're reactivating it, which is why it's a "reboot" of sorts. 

So here we are. My background is more in software and innovation programs, so we're going to reboot aiming for a structure a bit more like an open source project. We can form some loosely coupled working groups. My areas of interest include:

  - continuing the great work the chapter started at the local level
  - understanding the political landscape and providing context
  - creating a voter base around making government responsive to all citizens
  - applying well researched tools and methodologies openly and transparently
  
What are yours? Our next meeting will be on Thursday June 28, from 6p to 8p, at the Mission Police Department Community Room. [See the Meetup here](https://www.meetup.com/Represent-Us-SF-Bay-Area/events/251718867/)
